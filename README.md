# RottenTomatoForGamesAPI
This API is used to query games add reviews and see others' reviews.
## Wireframe/ERD
This was my initial ERD seeing as I only had one day to build this I think it was a little over-ambitious.

## Tech Stack
- Java SDK 17
- Spring Boot 2.7.15
- Spring Security
- JWT
- H2 Database
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDE
- Git


## Hurdles
Some hurdles I faced were:
- definitely time management and having ambitious goals for the time I was given. 
- Another hurdle had to do with making sure additions or changes were actually persistent in the database.

The main lesson learned is that I need to become a little more realistic with the size of projects that I make.
