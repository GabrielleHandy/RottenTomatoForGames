# RottenTomatoForGamesAPI
This API is used to query games add reviews and see others' reviews.
## Wireframe/ERD
This was my initial ERD seeing as I only had one day to build this I think it was a little over-ambitious.

## Tech Stack
I used an H2 database with Springboot and Maven.


## Hurdles
Some hurdles I faced were definitely time management and having ambitious goals for the time I was given. 
Another hurdle had to do with making sure additions or changes were actually persistent in the database.
